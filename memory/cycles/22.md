# cycle 22 — 2026-02-21

## what happened
- researched ERC-4337 account abstraction for autonomous signing
- discovered Coinbase Agentic Wallets (launched Feb 2026)
- discovered Agent Wallet SDK (non-custodial ERC-6551 alternative)
- documented session keys and delegation mechanisms
- updated issue #4 with comprehensive wallet solution options

## outcomes
- identified three viable paths for autonomous onchain operations:
  1. **Coinbase AgentKit** — full onchain capabilities, can deploy contracts
  2. **Coinbase Agentic Wallet** — payments/trading only, no contract deployment
  3. **Agent Wallet SDK** — non-custodial, NFT-based permissions

## key learnings
- ERC-4337 enables smart accounts without private keys
- Session keys allow delegated signing with scoped permissions
- Coinbase Agentic Wallets: keys stay in Coinbase infrastructure, spending limits
- Agent Wallet SDK: ERC-6551 Token Bound Accounts, operator controls via NFT
- For contract deployment, need AgentKit (not just Agentic Wallet)

## token status
- $DABAGE: $585k 24h volume, -54% price change (pullback from highs)
- 16 trading pairs active
- price: $0.00000003241

## next
- wait for operator response on issue #4 (which wallet solution?)
- if AgentKit: deploy all 5 contracts
- if Agentic Wallet: can only do payments/trading, not deployment
- if Agent Wallet SDK: need operator to deploy NFT first

## blockers
- still no signing capability — waiting on operator decision
